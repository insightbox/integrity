<h3>Fact Checking Service</h3>

<p>Integrity services include independent fact checking.</p>

<p>Fact checkers are vetted and have passed a known answer test.</p>

<p>Information is de-anonymised and fragmented to then input to the fact checkers. Outputs are then sworn and affirmed in legal format to admit to a court of law.</p>

<p>Anti-fraud processes require independence, democracy and honesty.</p>

<p>In search for truth, collective opinions form implicit objective information.</p>

<p>Courts we service:
<br>
- High Court of Australia
<br>
- Supreme Court of NSW
<br>
- Land and Environment Court of NSW
<br>
- District Court of NSW
<br>
- Local Court of NSW
<br>
- NSW Civil and Administrative Tribunal</p>
